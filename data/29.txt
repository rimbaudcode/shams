29. Destiny doesn't mean that your life has been strictly predetermined. Therefore, to live everything to the fate and to not actively contribute to the music of the universe is a sign of sheer ignorance. The music of the universe is all pervading and it is composed on forty different levels. Your destiny is the level where you play your tune. You might not change your instrument but how well to play is entirely in your hands.
